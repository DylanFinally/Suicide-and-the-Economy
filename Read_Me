This project aims at assessing which socioeconomic factors most critically influence suicide rates. A two-way robust fixed effects model is thus employed. 

The inspiration for this endeavor stems from methodology employed by Yang (1992) and Blasco-Fontecilla et al. (2011),
who utilized a multi regression analysis and mixed effects model respectively to examine suicide rates.
